## Firefox
An isolated Firefox installation with access to host gpu acceleration and pulseaudio. Assumes UID=1000 and GID=1000.

For some reason performance is not good unless I give it my personal prefs.js file, I will investigate more to pinpoint what configs are needed.

This installation is also missing fonts and media codecs.
